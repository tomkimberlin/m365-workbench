M365 Workbench is a Windows desktop utility for Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Intune support work. The current release provides a searchable Windows device inventory with on-demand Windows LAPS and BitLocker recovery.

> **Status:** Early release. Device inventory and recovery are functional and covered by offline tests. The app currently performs Microsoft Graph reads only; device actions and other modules remain roadmap items.

## What it does

- Searches Windows devices by name, user, UPN, serial number, model, or Entra device ID.
- Combines Intune managed-device data with Entra device, Windows LAPS, and BitLocker metadata.
- Identifies Entra-only records without assuming they are stale or safe to delete.
- Shows device, management, compliance, encryption, sync, and approximate Entra activity details.
- Opens the selected device directly in the Intune or Entra admin center.
- Retrieves one selected LAPS password or BitLocker recovery key only after an explicit copy or reveal action.
- Verifies the current Windows user before recovery access and uses a fresh Microsoft device-code verification when local verification is unavailable.
- Excludes copied secrets from Windows Clipboard History and Cloud Clipboard and clears them after a configurable interval.

All screenshots, tests, and demo records use fictional `contoso` identities and explicit `DEMO-DEVICE-*` identifiers.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- PowerShell 7.4 or later
- `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` 2.38.0 or later
- A Microsoft Entra work or school account in the configured tenant

Both the standard PowerShell installer and Microsoft Store installation are supported. The launcher also checks absolute directories on `PATH`. The window title identifies the current build as `2026.09.05`.

## Quick start

Clone the repository and install the Graph authentication module:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/tomkimberlin/m365-workbench.git
Set-Location .\m365-workbench
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser
```

Create the ignored local settings file:

```powershell
Copy-Item .\M365Workbench.settings.example.psd1 .\M365Workbench.settings.psd1
```

Replace the fictional tenant domain, tenant object ID, and expected administrator UPN in `M365Workbench.settings.psd1`, then launch:

```powershell
.\Launch-M365Workbench.cmd
```

To install a desktop shortcut with the application icon and no console flash:

```powershell
pwsh.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\Install-DesktopShortcut.ps1
```

The app reuses Microsoft Graph's secure `CurrentUser` token cache when a valid delegated context already exists. If sign-in is required, it displays a device code and opens Microsoft's sign-in page in the default browser.

By default, the first recovery action asks Windows to verify the current user with an available PIN, biometric, or Windows Hello method. That verification is remembered in process memory for ten minutes. If local Windows verification is unavailable, a fresh interactive Microsoft sign-in completed during app startup can satisfy the fallback for the remainder of the same fixed window. Otherwise, the app displays a new Microsoft device code without replacing or clearing the reusable Graph session. Conditional Access determines whether the Microsoft step also requires MFA; the app does not claim that a device-code completion is inherently MFA.

These settings control that behavior:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SecretVerificationMode` | `Preferred` | Use Windows verification first, then Microsoft verification only when Windows reports that local verification is unavailable. |
| `SecretVerificationSeconds` | `600` | Fixed verification window, from 60 to 3600 seconds. It does not slide with continued use. |

`Required` disables the Microsoft fallback and permits recovery only after local Windows verification. `Disabled` is an explicit administrative opt-out. Windows 10 remains supported through feature detection and the Microsoft fallback when the desktop Windows verification interface is unavailable.

## Try it without a tenant

Demo mode is entirely local. It does not load a settings file, authenticate, or call Microsoft Graph.

```powershell
pwsh.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -STA -File .\M365Workbench.ps1 -DemoMode
```

Off-screen preview rendering requires `-DemoMode`; live tenant data cannot be exported through the preview switch.

## Microsoft Graph permissions

The current workspace requests these delegated scopes together:

| Scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Device.Read.All` | Entra device information |
| `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` | Intune managed-device inventory |
| `DeviceLocalCredential.Read.All` | Windows LAPS metadata and selected password retrieval |
| `BitlockerKey.ReadBasic.All` | BitLocker recovery-key metadata |
| `BitlockerKey.Read.All` | Selected BitLocker recovery-key retrieval |

Administrator consent may be required. The signed-in operator must also have directory roles or custom-role actions that authorize the requested recovery data. Review Microsoft's current documentation before deployment:

- [Get deviceLocalCredentialInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/devicelocalcredentialinfo-get?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Use Windows LAPS with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/devices/howto-manage-local-admin-passwords)
- [List Intune managed devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/intune-devices-manageddevice-list?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [List BitLocker recovery keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/bitlocker-list-recoverykeys?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Get a BitLocker recovery key](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/bitlockerrecoverykey-get?view=graph-rest-1.0)

## Security design

M365 Workbench handles privileged recovery material, so its recovery flow is deliberately narrow:

- Authentication is delegated and interactive; the project includes no unattended privileged identity or credential.
- Tenant-specific settings are local and ignored by Git.
- Inventory refreshes request metadata only, never LAPS passwords or BitLocker key values.
- A secret is fetched only for the selected device and only after **Copy** or **Reveal briefly**.
- Both newly fetched and briefly cached recovery values pass through the same user-verification gate.
- Local verification is revoked when its fixed timer expires, when Windows locks or disconnects the session, and when the app closes.
- The Microsoft fallback runs in a separate process-scoped Graph session, validates the configured tenant and account, requires a newly observed device code, and returns no token to the app.
- Secrets are not intentionally written to files, logs, or PowerShell history.
- Revealed secrets hide automatically, and copied secrets are cleared only if the clipboard still contains the value written by this app.
- Reveal and clipboard deadlines use elapsed time, so changing the Windows clock cannot extend them. Busy clipboard cleanup retries; normal closing waits for pending cleanup rather than silently abandoning it.
- Intune and recovery records are joined by Entra device ID, not mutable device name.
- There is no bulk secret export path.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to report a vulnerability. Never put production tenant data, device names, screenshots, secrets, or logs in a public issue.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `Ctrl + F` focuses device search.
- `Ctrl + Shift + C` copies the secret from the active LAPS or BitLocker tab.
- `F5` refreshes inventory.
- `Esc` immediately hides a revealed secret.

## Tests

The offline suite parses the PowerShell and WPF markup and validates data joining, authentication-context enforcement, secret decoding, portal-link validation, metadata-only inventory, clipboard protection, the no-console launcher, and key UI regressions. It also executes the production recovery operations with synthetic Graph responses and tests clipboard race/cleanup behavior with native-call shims. It does not connect to Microsoft Graph or overwrite your clipboard. Generated test files are placed in a unique system temporary directory and cleaned up on exit.

See the [September 2026 audit notes](docs/AUDIT-2026-09-05.md) for fixed issues, verification coverage, and remaining limits.

```powershell
pwsh.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\Tests\Test-M365Workbench.ps1
```

## Project scope

Entra ID spans identity, access, applications, roles, and device identities. Intune focuses on endpoint and application management. M365 Workbench is intended to grow into focused modules for common support workflows, not reproduce every Microsoft portal or replace Azure Arc, Defender, Configuration Manager, or full server-management tooling.
